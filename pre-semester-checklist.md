# Things to address with GSIs

1. Decide on shifts for Evening Study Session.
2. Discuss principles for late work
    - Should extensions be at the discretion of the GSI?
    - Create spreadsheet template where they can log extensions that were granted; GSIs make a private copy of this and pre-populate it with the names of students with DSP letters.
