# Learning Objectives

# What is Statistics?

Our goal for the course: to learn to critique and construct claims made using data. All claims are _models_: useful simplifications of reality.

## Descriptive
models: summary statistics
- counts
- proportions
- mean/median/mode
- variance, sd, iqr, mae
- correlation
- regression slopes (descriptive only: conditional average effect.)
models: graphics

prob concepts
- properties of distributions
            
## Causal
models: graphical models
- experimental design and RCT
- taxonomy of confounders
- ruling out confounders through regression

## Generalizations (is this stability?)
models:
- Two ways you can fail to generalize: by _design_ or by _chance_
- Design: ensure a representative sample (low bias)
- Chance: ensure low variance

## Predictive


# Reproducible Science

1. Def of a reproducible analysis
2. Tenets of reproducibility (data, code, explanation)
3. Roots in Nullius in Verbum
4. Complex data requires new tooks: R markdown
5. Motivation:
    - failure of tools (rogoff and reinhardt)
    - failure of publishing
        - reproducibility project in psychology
        - p-hacking and file drawer effect
        - nature statistics addendum
        - registered reports (PLOS)


# Intro to Data

- Definition of data frame
    - observations
    - variables
    - tidy data
- Taxonomy of data


## Describing Data
- Description usually involves summarization - what do you leave in? What is lost?
- Verbal summaries
    - 
    
- Numerical


# Desc Data lecture
Cat data
- bar charts
    Return to in GG
    - how should the bars be ordered?
        - decreasing order (works for nominal)
        - yes for ordinal (factors)
    - different geoms: bubble, pie
